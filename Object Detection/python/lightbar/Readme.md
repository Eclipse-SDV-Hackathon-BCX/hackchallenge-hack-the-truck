# Lightbar demo

This sample shows how to control the LED lightbar by sending eCAL messages.
All modes of the lightbar are activated for 3 seconds each, then all modes are activated simultaneously.

To run this example, make sure to have a Python environment which has eCAL installed (see [here](https://eclipse-ecal.github.io/ecal/getting_started/hello_world_python.html#dependencies))
